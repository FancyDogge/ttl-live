            <p>I've created this project to put it on my resume and for my presonal use.</p>
            <p>It has full CRUD functionality, registration, deadline reminders and also an email notifications when you register and log in.</p>
            <p>I'm also using external APIs to display current weather(based on user's location), exchange rates for RUB and also BTC/USD pair</p>
            <p>You can visit a dashboard to see your closest deadlines, paused and completed tasks</p>
            <p>For deadline reminders I'm using django-q library with redis as message broker</p>
